    <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
      </li>
      <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
      </li>
      <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
        are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
        dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
        science, people were selecting the best breeds."
      </li>
      <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.
      </li>
      <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
        that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
      </li>
      <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
    </ul>
